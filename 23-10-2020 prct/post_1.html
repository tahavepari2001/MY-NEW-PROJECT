                  <h2> HOLOGRAMS</h2> <p>A hologram is a three-dimensional graphical representation of an object which is projected onto a 
3D space and which can be seen with naked eye. 
In simple terms, it’s a virtual representation of an object.
SciFi holograms are yet very far-stretched into the future, but the technology has become evident enough to begin with.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Multimodal Acoustic Trap Display (MATD)</h2>
                    <p>ust like holograms, this technology also creates some stunning 3D imagery 
but the twist is that along with being visible to the naked eye, 
it can also be heard by your ears in real time and can also be felt by your skin. 
Interesting, right? It reminds you of the hologram of Princess Leia in Star Wars (this is only applicable to true Star Wars’ fans).
</p>
                    <p> Researchers at University of Sussex created MATD which uses ultrasound waves to trap a particle in 3D space and then colour it using appropriate lighting. 
The variable frequencies of ultrasound waves guide the particle through 3D space and with the help of it, the particle scans the 3D space in less than 0.1 second. 
Our eyes cannot keep a track of the moving particle, and as a result we see a single three-dimensional image in front of us.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Applications of this Technology</h2>
                        <p>This technology can be very useful in fields like biomedicine, design, architecture, entertainment, education and many more. 
The objects created by this technique are very small because this technology is still in its infancy stage. The width of the objects is roughly between 2 to 6 cm. 
But its also true that this technology is developing. Also, the effect of this technology on our health is yet to be explored.</p><a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/post-sample-image.jpg">
